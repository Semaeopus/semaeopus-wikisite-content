We are an award winning, small but mighty indie games studio that puts its energy into making relevant, fun and challenging games. You won't necessarily find weapons and combat in games that come from Semaeopus - you're more likely to use intellect and trickery as you explore in depth worlds, and meet unconventional characters along the way.

Our work covers two fronts: **_developing groundbreaking orginal IP_**, and **_work-for-hire as contract developers and design consultants_** helping clients achieve truly innovative games and interactive media through services including ideation, R&D, prototyping, production, and porting, accross PC and console.
