# Privacy Policy

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Semaeopus collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Semaeopus’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Semaeopus’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Semaeopus may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Semaeopus also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on offgridthegame.com forums. Semaeopus only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that forum commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the forum where the comment was left.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Semaeopus’s websites choose to interact with Semaeopus in ways that require Semaeopus to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Semaeopus gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at community.offgridthegame.com to provide a username and email address. In any case, Semaeopus collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Semaeopus. Semaeopus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Semaeopus may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. For instance, Semaeopus may monitor the most popular forums on the offgridthegame.com site or use spam screened by a third party service to help identify spam. Semaeopus may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Semaeopus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Semaeopus discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Semaeopus’s behalf or to provide services available at Semaeopus’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Semaeopus’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Semaeopus will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Semaeopus discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Semaeopus believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Semaeopus, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Semaeopus website and have supplied your email address, Semaeopus may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Semaeopus and our products. We primarily use our various product forums to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Semaeopus takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Semaeopus uses cookies to help Semaeopus identify and track visitors, their usage of a Semaeopus website, and their website access preferences. Semaeopus visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Semaeopus’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Semaeopus’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If Semaeopus, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Semaeopus goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Semaeopus may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Semaeopus and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Comments

Comments and other content submitted to a third party anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.
