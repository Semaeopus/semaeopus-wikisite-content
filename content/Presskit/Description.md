## Description

Semaeopus is a small but mighty indie games studio that puts its energy into making relevant, fun and challenging games. You won't necessarily find weapons and combat in games that come from Semaeopus - you're more likely to use stealth and trickery as you explore in depth worlds, and meet unconventional characters along the way. Their work covers two fronts: developing groundbreaking orginal IP, and work-for-hire as contract developers and design consultants helping clients achieve truly innovative games and interactive media through services including ideation, R and D, prototyping, production, and porting, accross PC and console.
