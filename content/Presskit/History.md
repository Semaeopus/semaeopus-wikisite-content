## History

Semaeopus was founded in early 2014 by Rich Metson and Pontus Sch√∂nberg, and is now a 10+ strong team of crafty creators and devs who have come to games seeking a bit more than just fun and creativity - they want to make games that contribute to the maturing of the medium.

Alongside design and development services Semaeopus is currently developing the stealth hacking game, Off Grid, which is to be the Studios first original IP.
